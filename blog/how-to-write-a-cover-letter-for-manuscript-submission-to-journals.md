 Before you submit your manuscript, there is one important task you need to do: creating a cover letter. This comes after the laborious effort of [polishing your manuscript](https://contentconcepts.in/services/academic_editing/manuscript_editing) and choosing a target journal. The cover letter is a crucial document that needs to say more to the editor than just that your work has been submitted for review. It should catch the editor's eye, explain the novelty and significance of your findings, show that all authors have accepted the submission, and show that the paper has not been simultaneously submitted to more than one journal.

Compelling cover letters introduce your article and present a valuable chance to persuade journal editors to consider publishing it.

## **Identify the requirements for your target journal.**

Before you start, check the author instructions for your intended journal to see if there are any cover letter specifications, such as specific, specifically worded remarks. No matter what else you decide to add, make sure your cover letter contains any necessary details and declarations outlined in the author instructions for your desired journal.

### **Create an outline and develop it later**

Every cover letter should include the following components in addition to any information and declarations that your target publication may require:

An introduction that includes the manuscript's title and the journal you are submitting it to.

1. Why your work is significant and pertinent to the journal's or field's readers.
2. The question your research seeks to answer.
3. Your key experimental findings and general conclusions.
4. The most significant findings you can make from your investigation.
5. A declaration that the paper has not been published and that it is not being considered for publication in any other journal
6. A declaration that all authors approved the work before being submitted to the journal.
7. Anything else the editor could need to be convinced to send your paper for review.

## Develop the cover letter based on the outline

Describe your motivation for writing, the name of your work, and the journal's name in the first few sentences of your cover letter.

Example: "I am writing to submit our manuscript for consideration for publication in the Archives of Ophthalmology, entitled "Taking antioxidants plus zinc decreases the incidence of advanced age-related macular degeneration for high-risk individuals."

## Revise the cover letter

You should check and edit your cover letter numerous times to ensure that it is concise and easy to understand. Eliminate extraneous details or sentences that do not directly connect to the study's main objectives, findings, and most crucial conclusions. Check your understanding of your findings' significance, originality, and applicability as you revise the cover letter. Rephrase overly wordy statements, fail to communicate your idea correctly, or contain too much information.
